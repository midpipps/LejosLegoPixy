# Lejos Lego Pixy
This is just a simple class used for talking to a Pixy with the Lego firmware installed on it.  I have not fully tested it but it seems to work for the most part.

using information pulled from 
https://github.com/charmedlabs/pixy/blob/master/src/device/main_m4/src/serial.cpp

This has been minimally tested on the EV3 with Lejos 0.9.1 EV3
